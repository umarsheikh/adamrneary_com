Hi, I’m Adam Neary. I am the Founder/CEO of Profitably, and I live in NYC with my amazing wife, Deepa, and our son, Arjun. :-)
</p>
<p>
My information is strewn all about, so here's a quick roadmap:
<ul>
	<li>I use this site (<a href="http://adamrneary.com/" target="_blank">adamrneary.com</a>) for longer form blogging and things I think people may actually care to read.</li>
	<li>I use <a href="http://adamrneary.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> for short-form blogging and more casual stuff (mostly food and political ravings).</li>
	<li>I use <a href="http://twitter.com/adamrneary" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for inane drivel, predominantly, and inside jokes.</li>
	<li>I use <a href="http://linkedin/in/adamrneary" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> as my resume. Everything you need to know about my professional background is there.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>current work</h2>

<a href="http://profitably.com/"><img class="company-logo" title="Profitably logo" src="images/Profitably_blugrn.jpg" alt="Profitably logo"></a>
<p class='clear'>
I am the Founder/CEO of a really exciting technology start-up called <a href="http://www.profitably.com/">Profitably</a>.
</p>
<p>
Profitably is web-based planning and analysis software for startups and small businesses…because Excel can be a real nightmare, and you’ve got work to do.
</p>
<p>
We help you plan for the customers you want, measure how you’re performing, and then execute. Today, most startups and small businesses do this work in a spreadsheet, which is a broken, time-consuming process that saps energy and focus. Profitably is a refreshing answer, and you can get started for free in minutes.
</p>

<h2>my previous lives</h2>

<div class="bioitem">
	<a href="http://www.atkearney.com/"><img class="company-logo" title="A.T. Kearney logo" src="images/AT-Kearney-logo1.jpg" alt="A.T. Kearney logo"></a>
	<p class='clear'>
		I got my start as more traditional management consultant at <strong><a href="http://atkearney.com/">A.T. Kearney</a></strong>. The experience at ATK was fantastic. I met my wife there, met my best friend, and learned everything there is to know about getting things done. I also became a major league data wonk at A.T. Kearney, and that’s become a defining trait.
	</p>
	<p>
		While at the firm, I helped grow the emerging Data Analytics team from 12 to over 50 in several years.
	</p>

<div class="bioitem-middle">
	<a href="http://www.concentra.co.uk/"><img class="company-logo" title="Concentra logo" src="images/concentra1.png" alt="Concentra logo"></a>
	<p class='clear'>
		I then joined up with a software start-up in London called <strong><a href="http://concentra.co.uk/">Concentra</a></strong>. I was brought in to launch a Business Intelligence team as part of a broader transformation from custom software shop to analytical consultancy, and there was no shortage of pints waiting right outside in sunny Borough Market.
	</p>
	<p>
		While at the firm, I helped drive explosive growth of the company from an lithe 14-person crew to an monster 64-person crew in 12 just months, bootstrapped and cash positive every step of the way.
	</p>

<div class="bioitem">
	<a href="http://www.alixpartners.com/"><img class="company-logo" title="AlixPartners logo" src="images/alixpartners1.jpg" alt="AlixPartners logo"></a>
	<p class='clear'>
		When Deepa and I got engaged, it was time to call off the trans-Atlantic grind, so I took a role as Vice President in the New York office of <strong><a href="http://alixpartners.com/">AlixPartners</a></strong>, the global leader in turnaround/restructuring.
	</p>
	<p>
		While at the firm, I added no value whatsoever.

hot yoga (baptiste particularly, but also bikram), cycling, food, wine, analytics, music, politics, family, elegant code, and entrepreneurship for its own sake…

<h2>a more heart-felt narrative</h2>

<p>
Thanks for coming to my site. You know, we see traffic from such a wide range of sources, it’s really tough to strike the right tone sometimes. But here it goes…
</p>
<p>
When I was little, my best friend and I used to put on puppet shows for younger kids’ birthday parties. Nothing special there, but then Microsoft Publisher came out, and I insisted on printing out brochures to distribute, and it became a “proper” business. The brochures made us seem so professional, and referrals brought us new business. Jackpot. Years later in high school I had a family friend in New York ship me cases (literally) of fake Oakleys from Canal Street so that I could resell them in Minnesota, where they were preciously scarce. For one summer, every kid in Eden Prairie was sporting “Joke-leys.” I spent my junior year in high school writing a 40-page business plan–entirely outside of class–for a ska music store, and I passed dispassionately (nay, apathetically) on recruiting upon graduation from Boston College because I was touring storefronts around Boston and Cambridge with ambitions of opening an acoustic cafe.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, it’s hard to believe that it took me until 2010 to realize that I wasn’t going to be happy unless I was an entrepreneur.
</p>
<p>
My wife Deepa, whom I met while working at A.T. Kearney, has noticed the transformation first hand. She says I have never been happier than since I left AlixPartners to start Profitably. And she’s right. You can see the energy and excitement in the video below, where we launched Profitably at DEMO out in San Francisco:

</p>
<p>
I consider myself tremendously lucky, because I live and work in a truly remarkable city within truly remarkable country. I get to go to work every day with some of the smartest people I’ve ever met solving the most interesting problem I’ve ever encountered. We’re serving startups and small businesses, the constituents of whom are some of the coolest people I’ve ever met and people who really need what we’re building.
</p>
<p>
Then, at the end of the day, I get to come home to my wife Deepa and son Arjun, and it all makes me feel like the luckiest guy in the world.
